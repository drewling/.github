## Security

The team at Drewl takes security within our products and services extremely seriously. This includes but is not limited to all open and closed-source projects hosted within GitHub.

We're a forever evolving team, learning new things daily for best practices and implementing those practices as quickly as possible. If you ever come across a security issue within any of our repositories or products, please get in touch with us so we can pass it on to the correct owners to fix.


## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Drewl-owned repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please send an email to security[@]drewl.com.

  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
